\chapter{Approach}
\label{chap:approach}
The approach usually starts with the problem definition and continues with what you
have done. Try to give an intuition first and describe everything with words and then
be more formal like ‘Let g be ...’.

\section{Problem Definition}

Start with a very short motivation why this is important. Then, as stated above,
describe the problem with words before getting formal.
