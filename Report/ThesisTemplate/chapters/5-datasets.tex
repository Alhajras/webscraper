\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{chap:evaluation}
In this chapter, our objective is to assess and examine the existing search engine implementation. The evaluation process is structured into three primary segments: Crawler, Indexer, and User Experience.

\section{Testing Environment}
\section{Crawler}  

To evaluate the web crawler, the following criteria can be employed for measurement:


{\renewcommand\labelitemi{}
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Coverage}: This metric measures the proportion of relevant web pages that the crawler can locate and fetch from the internet.

  \item \textbf{Scalability}: It evaluates the crawler's facility for efficiently scaling up to add more computing power to crawl more content.

  \item \textbf{Versatility}: Can the crawler be applied to explore diverse types of content from various websites, encompassing text, multimedia, and links?

  \item \textbf{Robustness}: The crawler's ability to adeptly manage challenging scenarios and errors.

  \item \textbf{Politeness}:  the extent to which the crawler respects the rules and policies of the web servers and avoids overloading them with requests and forbidden links.

\end{itemize}
