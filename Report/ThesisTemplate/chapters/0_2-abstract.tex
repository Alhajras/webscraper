\chapter*{Abstract}
In today's business landscape, online content analysis plays a crucial role in making informed decisions. However, existing solutions in this space are often proprietary, needing more transparency in their code and flexibility for customization and scalability. In this thesis, I introduce Scriburg, a prototype for a large-scale search engine that can be configured to suit specific user preferences. Scriburg has been developed to crawl efficiently and index web content, offering a range of settings through a user-friendly interface. The system is designed to handle small and large websites, making it adaptable to various scenarios. Scriburg is particularly well-suited for situations where users have a specific interest in a subset of the web, such as a particular domain or a select group of web pages. Despite the significance of web search engines, there remains a need for further academic research focused on developing and designing open-source search engine solutions that can be readily used and extended by a wide range of users.
