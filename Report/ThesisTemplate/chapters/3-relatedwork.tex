The concept of web crawling dates back to the early 1990s when the World Wide Web was still in its infancy.

WebCrawler, created by Brian Pinkerton in 1994, is considered the first true web crawler-powered search engine.

One of the major innovations of WebCrawler was its full-text searchability. This ability made it popular and highly functional. It continues to operate as a search engine, although not as popular as Google, Yahoo, Bing, Yandex, or Baidu.

Modern web crawlers face many challenges and complexities, such as dynamic content, user interaction, authentication, robots.txt files, and ethical issues. Some examples of modern web crawlers are Googlebot, Bingbot, and Internet Archive
