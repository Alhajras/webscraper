\chapter*{Abstract}
Online content analysis is crucial in making informed decisions in today's business landscape. However, existing solutions in this space are often proprietary, needing more transparency in their code and flexibility for customization and scalability. In this thesis, We introduce \textbf{Scriburg}, a prototype for a large-scale search engine that can be configured to suit specific user preferences. Scriburg has been developed to crawl efficiently and index web content, offering a range of settings through a user-friendly interface. The system is designed to handle small and large websites, making it adaptable to various scenarios. Scriburg is particularly well-suited for situations where users have a specific interest in a subset of the web, such as a particular domain or a select group of web pages. Despite the significance of web search engines, there remains a need for further academic research focused on developing and designing open-source search engine solutions that can be easily used and extended by a wide range of users.
